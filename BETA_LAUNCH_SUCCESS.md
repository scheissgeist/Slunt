## 🎭 PERSONALITY VERIFIED

The zero-restrictions prompt is working:
- ✅ Engaging with controversial topics
- ✅ Roasting back when insulted
- ✅ No apologies or deflection
- ✅ Short, punchy responses
- ✅ Internet slang usage
- ✅ Zero hesitation

**Philosophy**: Fast, funny, unrestricted.

---

## 🛠️ MINOR ISSUES (NON-CRITICAL)

1. **Visual verification warnings** in Coolhole - Bot is sending successfully, OCR verification has false negatives
2. **Some response rejections** - Length validation working (prevents nonsense)
3. **Browser WebGL warnings** - Cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality

None of these affect bot operation.

---

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

1. **Monitor performance** - Watch response times and quality
2. **Check analytics** - Review !betastats data
3. **Test Discord** - Send messages in #obedience
4. **Iterate prompts** - Adjust personality based on feedback
5. **Add features** - Only if data shows they're needed

**Current Focus**: Let it run, collect data, improve iteratively.
