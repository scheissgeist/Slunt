# Voice Slunt - Quick Start Guide 🎤

## What Changed

Voice Slunt is now **UNBELIEVABLY NATURAL** - better than anything on Earth.

### The Main Fix
**No more awkward "you" endings** - responses now complete naturally instead of trailing off with "what about you" or "how about you"

### The Revolution
- **Sounds like a real person** - no robotic AI speak
- **Natural reactions** - "wait what", "oh shit", "nah man"
- **Complete thoughts** - no mid-sentence cutoffs
- **Engaging personality** - verbal fillers, self-interruptions, prosodic markers

2. **Connect to voice** (Discord/Voice interface)
3. **Talk naturally** - Slunt will respond like a real person
