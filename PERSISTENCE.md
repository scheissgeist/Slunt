### ðŸ”„ Temporary (Resets Each Session)

These reset on restart because they're meant to track current state:

1. **Mental State** (depression, anxiety, confidence)
   - Current emotional state
   - Resets to baseline each session

2. **Drunk Mode** (intoxication level)
   - Current drunkenness
   - Hangover state
   - Resets sober each session

3. **Current Obsession** (topic fixation)
   - What Slunt is currently obsessed with
   - Changes naturally during session

4. **Dopamine System** (reward tracking)
   - Current dopamine level
   - Recent activities
   - Resets to baseline

5. **Autism Fixations** (current special interests)
   - Active fixation
   - Intensity level
   - Resets each session

6. **Hipster Protocol** (band of the hour)
   - Current obscure band
   - Rotates every 2 hours
   - Resets to new band

## How It Works

### Auto-Save Systems
Most systems now auto-save immediately after important changes:
- **User reputation**: Saves when trust/drama/helpfulness changes
- **Relationships**: Saves when relationship strength updates
- **Gold system**: Saves when learning new gold patterns
- **Diary**: Saves after each new entry

### Load on Startup
When Slunt starts, these systems automatically load their saved data:
```
ðŸ“” [Diary] Loaded 81 entries from disk
ðŸ‘¤ [Reputation] Loaded 15 user reputations from disk
ðŸ”— [Relationships] Loaded 42 relationships from disk
ðŸ’° [Gold] Loaded 23 gold messages and patterns from disk
```

### File Locations
All persistent data is stored in `./data/` directory:
- `coolpoints.json` - Virtual currency
- `diary.json` - Diary entries
- `user_reputations.json` - User trust/drama/helpfulness
- `relationships.json` - Social graph
- `gold_system.json` - Gold learning
- `dreams.json` - Dream predictions
- `slunt_brain.json` - Personality, chat history, videos
- `memory_archive.json` - Important memories
- `chat_memory.json` - Chat context

## Benefits

1. **Continuous Learning**: Slunt remembers what he learned about users
2. **Relationship Continuity**: Friendships and social dynamics persist
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Gold system learns what's funny over time
4. **Trust Building**: User reputations accumulate across sessions
5. **No Reset Frustration**: Users don't lose progress with Slunt

## Dashboard Updates

**Mind Data**: Updates every **5 seconds** (emotional state, personality, current mood)
**Diary**: Updates every **10 minutes** (thoughts and observations)

Mind data updates frequently because it's his "current feelings" - like checking his mood in real-time. Diary updates slowly because those are his longer reflections.
