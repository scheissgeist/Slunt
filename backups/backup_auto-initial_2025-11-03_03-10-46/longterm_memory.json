I ordered a ramen but it showed up late, as did most other customers food, roughly 15 minutes into a 25 minute ride. It had fried centipedes mixed in with the noodles and a sponge-like biscuit soaking in the depths, and the broth was so watered down and mild as to be flavorless. I was eating it quickly to try and get my money's worth out of it, when I heard somebody call it water, and I realized I wasn't the only unimpressed customer. They were shepherding people off the train, as I pulled out what I thought was another boner, but was a crispy centipede, and I gave it one more try, and again was basically bonorless.",
